# Rationale ways of thinking:

## Step 1: 
Organise informations, read about Merino, went to the Icebreaker website and have a read through
what do we want to achieve, notice some patterns that we'll use this page as a landing page for the first time users
to learn about MerinoLOFT innovation.

## Step 2: 
Think why the user and how it would stand out if the user wants to click/see more.
Thought about how we would want to show the items on the "Shop this look" when only a button could not be enough for some users,
so decided to add small boxes of items which they could hover/view more for the specific item.
Carousel added dots/arrows for easier interaction and it's better UX for users on touch screens.

## Step 3: 
Structure the files into separate folders/CSS/HTML and start the base of the website and linked to GitHub or Bitbucket

## Step 4: 
Make the website mobile-first while adding new features/ideas which I've thought, while wireframing on paper.

## Step 5: 
Launch
